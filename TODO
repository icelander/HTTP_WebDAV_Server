Short term (1.0 show stoppers):

- API cleanups

- documentation

- "Depth: Infinite" not supported yet (in fileserver PROPFIND)

- properties not copied/moved (in fileserver COPY/MOVE)

- check url en-/decodings

Medium term (nice to have in 1.0):

- ETags support ...

- MIME-type detection should become a
  package of its own?

- mimetype may be guessed for stream
  (mime_magic extension now supports this in HEAD)

- provide helper classes that extend the
  Server class by adding prepared LOCKing 
  functionality, eg.:
	- HTTP_WebDAV_Server_Lock_MySQL
	- HTTP_WebDAV_Server_Lock_dbm
	- HTTP_WebDAV_Server_Lock_PearDB
  - ...
  (have to dig out my design pattern book ...?)



Long term (definetly not in 1.0 or even 1.x):

- the XML parsing parts are *very* Q&D

- Versioning 

- DASL

- ...
